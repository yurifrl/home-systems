        # - This alert is like monitoring how much water you consume in a desert trip.
        # - Imagine your total water (Error Budget) is 10 liters to last for 100 km.
        # - You can drink a small amount of water each day, but if you drink too much too quickly, you’ll run out.
        # - This alert fires when CoreDNS is consuming its error budget (like drinking water) too quickly over a 5-minute window.
        # - **Immediate action required** to prevent running out of error budget (water).
